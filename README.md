# Mental Rotation Task

### Task

We created a repository and cloned the files from the departure point. Next we changed the template according to the homework requirements. Which included the following:
* replace the 2-alternative forced choice task with a key-press task
* instantiate five trials of a key-press task
* key presses should be recorded as “same” and “different”
* show one of the mental-rotation pictures obtainable here on each trial
* code the key press choices as “correct” or “incorrect” based on the picture shown
* add to the trial information (in 03_trials.js) the following information (so that this is shown in the final output; because we might need it for analysis):
    * number of picture shown
    * degree of rotation
    * whether the picture’s objects are indeed “same” or “different”
